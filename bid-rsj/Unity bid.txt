Hello,

I'm a developer with more than 12 years of experience and I have a development team and can deal with the most complex tasks.
I checked your job description and can definitely help you with that.

I have the necessary expertise with Mobile and Web development. I have good experience in Unity and C#, TensorFlow (especially for AR/VR projects and games). Almost all my AR/VR and game projects are based on Unity.

If you could give me more details on the current technical challenges you face or the resources you need to push it further, that would be a good starting point. I will be happy to invest the necessary effort so that you could build up an impression about our capabilities and make sure that we are good to come on board. If necessary, I am ready to sign the NDA.

It would be great to know how you envision the product scope, timeline, deliverables, and I can guide you on the development process.
Also, I can provide detailed technical responses and guidance on a technical call.

I'm ready to sign the NDA if you have one.

Hello,
My name is Ihor, and I'm a gameplay/engine programmer who has just started working as an independent game developer, focusing on small or large games using the C++ / UE4 engine. I also work directly at Epic on UE4 engine development.

http://www.starkgaming.com/
In December of 2019, Stark Gaming received an Epic MegaGrant for our work on CastleDay and Vertical Third.
https://starkgaminginc.itch.io/squishems
Squishems is our 2019 Unreal Engine MegaJam entry which is an online MerCat Brawler!

My key value is the approach to never give up, always keep learning, and leap over obstacles that pop up. The word "can't" is simply NOT in my vocabulary.
Let's connect for more details

Best Regards,
Ihor

Hello there, I would love to help you with your project. I have over 5 to almost 6 years of experience in game development with Unreal Engine and Unity 3D. I have created a lot of projects from which I have published 8 games on Steam and Google Play Store. I have experience with Vuforia, photon network. One of my published games on Google Play Store, has Vuforia as I had to use the AR system to make it work, I can send a link if you want. If you are still looking for someone to do the job, reply back to me. Thank you very much!

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

We specialize in rapid prototyping using game technology. While it seems you may be looking for someone to do the entire project, we are convinced that starting with a prototype would be a great first step.


Here's a brief overview of some of our experience which we believe would be relevant for this project:

- Most of the time we prototype in C# (usually within the Unity engine), while we also work with other languages, such as php and MySQL for back-end development, and C++ for instance when making external code libraries accessible for use in C#.

- Over the years, weâ€™ve developed numerous mobile game prototypes â€“ three of which are highlighted in the following blog post: https://previewlabs.com/mobile-game-prototypes/

- We have been prototyping with Unity since Unity 2.x and are very familar with the engine. We have even prototyped directly for Unity Technologies to help them test their Entity Component System (ECS).


Would you be interested in a call to discuss your project in greater detail? If you send me a message in response to this proposal we can find a time for a call.



Kind regards,
Bernard
