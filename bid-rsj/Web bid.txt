Hello, Sir
As a frontend heavy JavaScript full stack developer, I'm very interested in this position

My last contract was a full stack developer position in dexpool, my role included 70% of frontend tasks and 30% of backend tasks
The project was built with react(next js), nest js(backend), and firebase
I really did a good job
Also, prior to this contract, I've worked with some companies and most of them were using react for the frontend development
So I'm really good at react js and I love it

Yes, we had a weekly meeting for the project discussion and if something is urgent, we had a meeting
In short words, with my last team experience, I'm very familiar with the agile environment

Sure, I'd like to take a test because I can show my skills fully

These are my last Dexpool and other react projects
