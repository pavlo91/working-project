Hello! We´re the perfect fit for this DAO Project, as we´re extremely experienced in custom software development, especially in Metaverse projects. We have already designed, developed and launched tons of web apps and web platforms from scratch before. We´re an international Award-winning custom software development Agency with 10+ years of experience, and many of our projects have been awarded and praised (please see attached link below for our portfolio)!

Understood regarding the requirements! They're clear so far, thank you. We're extremely experienced and qualified in all the mentioned technologies. Will you be providing more detailed Low-Level Requirements or do we need to assist in putting these together? (if so no worries, just asking in advance to begin thinking about the tasks per milestones and general Work Plan).

We´re guaranteeing the results for this project.
Work Methodology:
-Daily updates through $lack
-Feedback/bugs/fixes: tracked on ClickUp
-UXUI Designs: Live corrections/feedback through Figma.

Work description in detail: First we´ll conduct a detailed survey of the requirements and low-level-requirements/user stories.
Afterwards, we'll establish the detailed Work Plan, breaking up every stage of the Project into different and clearly established Milestones. Then we ́ll begin setting up the staging server and building the architecture for the database. Afterwards, in case ux ui design is needed from our side, we´ll come up with the design wireframes to provide the general structure, and to receive and apply your feedback.

Once we´re on the same page and your suggestions have been implemented, we´ll move forward adding design, style, fonts and colors to the wireframes and share initial designs for your review. Once they´re approved, we´ll move forward with the development. Complete design files are shared once the designs have been approved. Source codes are delivered at the end of each Milestone. At the end of the project after Testing and debugging, we´ll go live and migrate it to the Live Server on the account of your choosing.

Budget and Milestones: The budget will be equally distributed among the Milestones.
Detailed tasks by Milestone are established after getting hired and getting the Work Plan defined together with you. In that way, we can all set clear expectations for each Milestone and keep an organized and streamlined process for the project. Weeks per Milestone= 2 weeks (this could vary once we define the Work Plan but it's a good standard to use as reference for now).


****PLACEHOLDER BID**** Timeframe and budget will be confirmed after reviewing the low-level requirements and getting more details on the project. Looking forward to helping you make an amazing transport mobility simulation platform for your business to grow!

Greetings! 😊

My name is Alex, I'm a full stack blockchain developer with other 6 years of relevant experience. I’m pretty familiar with DAO and blockchain development.
So I'll be glad to provide you with my skills and knowledge

I have acquainted with your application. First of will for development of DAO we need to come up with concept of your project and after that understand the scope of work that should be done. And here we need to answer the several questions:

1) First of all, it is a concept and the idea behind your project because it is essentially the community and the idea for community gathering can be next: your own metaverse with a special lore, some history or it can be DAO idea which is related to already existed project like popular computer game or serial.

2) The functionality of DAO, what kind of tokenomics will you have: will it be based on your special cryptocurrency which can be easily exchanged as money for another (BTC/ETH as analogue) or will it based on Non-fungible token (NFT) with a special art collections (from pictures to music) which can be resold on different exchanges, for which you, as the original owner, will receive royalties on sale.

3) The next step is to choose a blockchain network (for example Ethereum or Polygon) and develop smart contracts which will create your tokens.

As you said, I've tried to briefly talk about DAO, so the additional information with examples I will provide in separate questions.

All in all, looking forward to calling or chatting to brainstorm your DAO project!
