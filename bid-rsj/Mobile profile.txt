Hi, my name is Mustafa and I am a freelance mobile and web designer and developer. I am an extremely hard worker and active communicator. My background is in mobile and web applications design and development. I have Bachelors degree in Software Engineering and Masters in Software Project Management.

I have a lot of freelance experience in graphic designing, mobile application development, game development and websites or web application development. I have designed and developed many applications for both android and ios. These include an application similar to Uber it was basically mixture of Uber and Tinder. I have developed dating application for both android and ios that worked on geolocation of the users to find them a perfect match. These also include restaurant management apps which allowed the user to order whatever he/she wants from the phone.
