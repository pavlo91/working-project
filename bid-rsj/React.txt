***********************Describe your approach to testing and improving QA*********************************



___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I prefer to write the unit tests in the development process.

First, I write the unit tests that should cover the functionality's critical parts (like authentication, form validation, payment flow, etc …). Then I cover with unit tests less critical stuff (if there is a time for that) to make sure that app is fully covered with unit tests.

Also, I prefer to use "pre-push" the Git hooks, which checks if all tests and linters pass successfully.

And last but not least, when feature development is in process, I check the UX if it is really comfortable for the end user, and if all failure cases are covered (like the required form fields or failed connection, etc …).

To achieve all of that, I use tools like Jest, React Testing Library, linter, husky, Chrome DevTools, etc.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. TDD (Test Driven Development) - We follow the TDD approach where the entire functional code is covered thru its unit test cases and all test cases must pass before the code/build is deployed in a production environment. Functional code is written as we keep populating the test cases until the unit test case covers the functional use case requirements.
Sample Test case: https://bit.ly/3g0WJMN  

2. Automated QA - With the use of QA automation (JS scripts) we can ensure that the application doesn't break anywhere in the workflow with the newly introduced features or modification of any code to support new feature deployment or bug fixes.

3. CD (Code Deployment)- With the continuous deployment we set up the pipelines in our DevOps framework to perform automated deployments on the respective environment (QA/STAGING/PROD) without the need of a manual deployment process. Before deployment, we can set up the conditions to ensure all automation QA test cases are passed which again leads to regression testing, and deploy the stable features on the releases.

These are the steps for improving QA approach :

1. Design review - this activity aims to verify that the software Design is written in conformance with the design standards, if any, adapted for a project and module/application is implemented as per quality requirements.
2. Project code review by peers
3. Unit testing - Unit testing is part of the software development life cycle that ensures that each piece of code that has been written performs the function that it is designed to do. This process comprises of the testing performed on the most basic item of the software project i.e. the individual code components to uncover the errors and to ensure that this is meeting all the specifications as described in the SDD (Database Design, Architecture Framework/ Flow Charts, and others).
4. Test case design and data selection
5. Module/ Integration testing - This process comprises the tests performed at the sub-system level to uncover errors related to interfaces among subsystems/software modules. Module/Integration Testing is a level of the software testing process where individual units are combined and tested as a group.
6. Automation testing (as required) - a test strategy is built and we develop an automation script and make sure all test script is running fine and should be stable enough.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

For testing my own code I have several main rules:
Check all regular (positive) scenarios.
Check all possible negative scenarios.
Check all edge cases.

Also, I cover the code with the unit, integrational, end-to-end tests using Jest, React Testing library, Cypress.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

It depends on the type of QA testing which is required on the project, time, priorities. It may be regression testing when firstly I create the test plan with basic test cases. Secondly, I do this regression testing each time before the release to check that all basic features work as expected. If some features are changed/added I have to update the test plan with test cases. It may be testing for some specific task. In this case I plan some checklist, test cases how I will verify the option. It may be testing some bug fix. In this case I have to check the scenario that produces this bug.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I think that writing unit and e2e tests is the best approach in the long run. It requires a little bit more time and resources in the beginning of a project, but drastically reduces the amount of time later in development. F .ex. I had a task to change some piece of code that was presented almost everywhere around the app. My initial estimation without unit tests was about 40 hours, because it was a very big project and I'd have to check if everything is alright manually, but with the use of unit tests I was able to reduce this time from 40 hours to 10 hours.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(1)Methodical approach, which is predicated on Fail Test Cases.
(2)We create Strategy then test the Products and Applications.
(3)Create Test Sheet-Create Test cases
(4) Cross Device Testing
(5) Bug Fixes
(6) Retesting

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The first step in testing and improving QA is to establish clear goals and metrics that define what success looks like for the project. This can include defining the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure the success of the QA efforts, such as the number of bugs found and resolved, the percentage of defects found before release, and the overall quality of the product or service.
Once the goals and metrics have been established, it is important to develop a comprehensive testing strategy that includes both manual and automated testing methods. Manual testing involves having human testers execute test cases and identify defects, while automated testing relies on tools and scripts to execute test cases and compare the actual results with expected results.
Continuous testing is another important aspect of QA, as it allows for early detection of defects and ensures that the product or service is tested throughout the development process. This can include running automated tests as part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, as well as conducting regular code reviews and performing regular audits to ensure that the testing processes are effective.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

My approach is e2e testing based on the Cypress.js service.
In my opinion, the most important point of QA is testing top-level business features using E2E
tests, so I can be sure that the business logic that the project implements works and does not regress with new features. But it is worth noting that this approach is not 100% coverage
for security holes since everything is tested together (front and back) and in addition to the
basic E2E tests, we can also separately cover specific places in the back API with unit tests to
be confident that, for example, the API works correctly from a security point of view and does
not give out unnecessary data, no matter how the request is configured.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

While writing the code I use debugger for code tracing or just place console logs, it depends on my needs.
In my opinion, the best way to test the code is to use a combination of unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, mocking/stubbing techniques and CI/CD. While testing the already written code, I use many tools, there’re some of them:
- [ ] Unit, Integration testing: Mocha, Jest for Node.js; Enzyme, Jest, React Testing Library, Vitest for React.js
- [ ] End-to-end testing: Cypress
- [ ] CI/CD: Gitlab CI/CD, Jenkins
- [ ] Mocking testing: Jest
It may also be a good idea to use Puppeteer for automated browser tests. To test an app on high loads or to see how it reacts on bulk requests, I use tools such as Load Runner, Artillery. To test how application works on different browsers, I use a BrowserStack tool. In addition to this, I use Postman utility to test my endpoints and see the reactions on different request entries.

Hello!😀

As a Senior Full-Stack React/Node.js developer well-versed in cutting-edge React, Node.js, TailwindCSS, TS, JS practices, I have the necessary skills (pls, look at https://piedwork.com) to be a good fit:🎯

✅ 9+ years of experience with React.js, Next.js, Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3 etc.
✅ Prior React/Node.js projects, where I was responsible for front-end as well as back-end development:

🔸 https://piedwork.com - a SaaS platform which allows to keep track of all company resources such as employees, managers, invoices, payments, etc. and keep everything in one place accessible by the managers accordingly. Some of the main features I developed are:
- automated invoice system
- accurate statistic and data blending
- time tracker
- current project dashboard
- employees database
- payment system
- API integration etc.

🔸 https://knowi.com - a BI platform that unifies analytics and business intelligence for NoSQL data, SQL data, and everything in between.

🔸 https://embedify.io - a SaaS platform which helps to make the process of creating new pages much easier with a single link and Google Doc page. The project has been developed in an Agile team.

🔸 https://bluemeg.com/ - SaaS provider of cloud-based entity management & corporate governance solutions.

My core tasks were: to build a highly-responsive, web-based User Interface; optimize speed and security; add new features, integrate APIs; conduct unit testing. I was using the latest React approaches (functional components over class components; higher-order functions to keep it DRY; proptypes; keeping components small and simple; code testing) etc.

My skill set:
✔ Javascript, Typescript, React / Next.js (Redux, Saga, Hooks, CSS, CSS modules, Styled components), Angular 2+, Vue.js / Nuxt.js (Vuex; Vuetify)
✔ Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js with complex library (Bull.js for jobs etc)
✔ Java, Spring Boot
✔ Go (Gin, Echo)
✔ Ubuntu, Docker, Docker-compose
✔ HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, TailwindCSS
✔ API (Restful, RPC, GraphQL)
✔ Using design libraries like Material UI, Ant design, Native design by blocks and flags etc.
✔ Testing (Mocha (Chai, Sinon), Jest, Cypress)
