I hope you are well. thanks for visiting my profile. if you are looking for a full-stack developer.

I am very strong at core technologies, frameworks, and languages. I can work on relatively complex projects/tasks with relative ease.

I've been a programmer for over 7 years and have a lot of experience to bring to the table. I have a Bachelors's in computer science.

Here are some benefits I can think of if you want to hire me:

something that I THINK you want

- I'm pretty fluent in English, you will have no problem explaining what you want.

- I'll work in your timezone

- I'm always available for accurate and honest communication

- I am quite creative, I will frequently give you out-of-the-box ideas for your product and its features. Clients love this!

- I have a list of clients from Europe/USA that would highly recommend me

- I'm excellent at programming, so I will almost always find a way to do what other programmers might say is "Impossible to implement" stuff
